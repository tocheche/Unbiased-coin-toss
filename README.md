# Unbiased-coin-toss
The torque-free motion of rigid body in gravitational field is analyzed. The coin lands on a soft surface (such as the palm of the hand) that allows no bouncing. The model assumes the coin as a rigid body with constant angular momentum vector in the body frame, and no air resistance. Unbiased probabilities of heads and tails are obtained for various initial conditions accessible to a usual person.
